## This Year's Gonna Be Different!

I already swore off other Social Media platforms (TikTok, Instagram, Twitter, etc.) years ago and felt my mental health improve. I'm doing the same for the rest. I haven't been on YouTube and Reddit (the only 2 I use now) in the last 3 days. Feels. Freaking. Great. I'll pass through from time to time -- but the constant daily checking - all of that is done. We're moving to a new place. ❤️

If you haven't taken a break from Social Media, the New Year is a perfect time to start. You don't have to swear them off completely -- perhaps just commit to a black-out day for the week, and then take if from there. Your mental health with thank you. 😊

Much love! Talk to you soon. ^_^
