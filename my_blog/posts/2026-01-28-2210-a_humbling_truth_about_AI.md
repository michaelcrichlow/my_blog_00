## A Humbling Truth about AI

I'm not here to talk about all the ways AI s bad or problematic (there are tons of resources for that). Rather, I was working with someone yesterday and it really revealed to me the difference between talking with people and talking with ChatGPT. I was trying to help them build a service and try as I might, we kept hitting disagreements and misunderstandings. Then I had a profound realization:

  
ChatGPT meets you where you are and helps do what you want to do in the way you want to do it. 
  
  
People almost never do this. There's always a discussion: "Well, I think we should do it like this." Or "That solution won't last. We really should do it this way instead." So, a non-trivial part of working with people is persuading them to a way of thinking that aligns with yours. Being patient and explaining your point of view while understanding that everyone has their own story and motivations. 
  
  
None of that is necessary with ChatGPT. 
  
  
It helps you to build your thing, your way. And that, that -- is profoundly helpful (and I think that's the main reason it's connecting with so many people). I don't use it for art, but I do use it for coding -- and it's very useful. 

On the other hand, while it does help you build the thing you want in the way you want to build it -- it won't tell you that the way you're doing it is profoundly dumb. It just helps you do it. Then later, sometimes I've been like, "Well, this is really wasteful way to do this. I can do this better." Then I go back with a newer idea -- a better, streamlined idea -- and it helps me make that! You see? It just meets you where you are. Then I start to ask questions like "I want to make an efficient version of this. Help me do that." Trying to think ahead, ya know? It's wild to use something that is so profoundly helpful. 

That is the profound power of a capable llm -- meeting you where you are and helping you accomplish your goal in a way that makes sense to you. The humbling truth is that this approach is sincerely helpful. Where does all of this AI stuff go? I dunno. But if llms disappeared tomorrow, it would be like Google search disappearing. You could go on -- but you'd miss it (and you'd be lying if you said you didn't).
