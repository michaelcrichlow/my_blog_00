## Frustrations on Programming - A Short Story

I've been thinking about programming (yes, I do that a lot) and I thought of another analogy that describes my feelings/frustrations with programming pretty well. Suppose you're hired to work at a place for 5 days: Monday through Friday. Seems simple enough (if a bit short). Regardless, you're determined to go in there and try your best.

 

On day one you go in and they assign you a task: ride a bicycle to a building 2 blocks away, collect an item and then return to the office. That's it. Seems simple enough. Except you don't know how to ride a bike. So, this fairly simple task is undone by the fact that you don't know how to do it. Regardless, you grit your teeth and commit to get the job done. You fall a lot (there are a lot of scrapped knees and bloodied elbows by the end of the day), but you get it done. Huzzah you did it. Good job - day one is done. You go home, declaring that you need to learn how to ride a bike. That's a "foundational" skill that EVERYBODY should know. Right?

 

On Tuesday you show up sleepy-eyed (since you've been practicing riding a bike at home into the night (but you're getting a lot better at it - so it should be worth it)). Once there, they assign you a task: swim from one end of a pool to the other, collect an item and then swim back. Seems straightforward enough, except for one thing: you don't know how to swim. You ask them to double-check the task: "Are you sure it's swimming? I think I've been assigned to bicycle tasks." They look down and check their notes. "No," they say. "Just swimming today." So, you have a terrible day of over-effort and almost drowning, but you finally manage to get the item from one end of the pool to the other. Huzzah you did it. Good job - day two is done. You walk home dripping wet (you didn't bring a towel - why would you?) and collapse on your bed once you're there.

 

On Wednesday you show up and you're a little annoyed. You didn't get to practice riding a bike (you were so tired yesterday, so you feel behind on that) and since you fell asleep in wet clothes, you woke up with a bit of cold. "Ah-CHOO!", you sneeze as you enter the office. Wiping your runny nose with a paper towel, you ready yourself for the task of the day. At least you brought a towel today. A smart looking woman with a clipboard approaches you and says, "Come with me." You follow her to a large room, open the door -- and see a pair of thirty-foot tall stilts resting in the corner. "Your task," she says, pointing to two platforms floating thirty feet in the air at opposite sides of the room, "is to swap the positions of the buckets on those platforms. The red one is supposed to be on the red platform and the blue one is supposed to be on the blue platform. As you can see, they're swapped. Fix that." With that, she promptly walks out, leaving you alone in the room with the slits, the platforms and the buckets (and your towel for all that helps you). sigh Well, you don't know how to use stilts, but you figure something out. You use one of the stilts as a long stick to knock each bucket off the platform. Then annoyingly -- agonizingly -- you get each bucket up to the correct platform using the stilt like a long fishing pole - balancing the bucket on the end. Huzzah you did it. Good job - day three is done. Your arms ache from lifting the stilts all day and your runny nose didn't help. You go home and pass out on your bed. 

 

On Thursday, you show up and can tell that you're a little on edge. You're tired, your muscles ache, you have a headache -- and to top it all off, you forgot your towel. Do you even need it? A coworker greets you with a bright "Good Morning!" and you snap at her, "What's so good about it?" She looks offended and quickly walks away with her head down. You immediately feel bad about it, but before you can track her down to apologize, a smart looking man with a clipboard approaches you. "Follow me", he says - and starts walking down the hallway.

 

He takes you to a room with - surprisingly, three chickens running around. Before you is a table with three big, empty, silver bowls. Next to the bowls is a knife and three bags made out thick, clear plastic. The man turns to you, points to the chickens and says, "Catch them, kill them, pluck them, dice them and put the prepared meat in those three bags." Then he walks out. You sink to the floor and look at the chickens running around so quickly you'd swear they were part greyhound. You're supposed to kill these animals? (Something you've never done). You can't even see yourself catching them with the speed they're moving now. Maybe they'll tire out. You wait for an hour -- and the chickens are running around at exactly the same speed. If anything, they're faster now. You leave the room, find the smart looking man, tell him you weren't able to do it, apologize -- and then slowly walk home.

 

On Friday you arrive with mixed emotions. This is the last day of the job (so after this you're back to job-hunting), but at least after today there won't be any more surprises. You go in, sit down and wait to given your final task. A short, smart-looking lady with glasses comes up to you. "Follow me", she says and you both head outside. She takes you to a greenhouse full of fruits and vegetables and hands you a bowl. "Today's an easy one -- just pick the ripe ones, put them in the bowl and you can go home." As she starts to leave, suddenly - with such force that it surprises yourself - you start to cry. A wailing, frustrated cry. "Oh, dear!" she says as rushes back to your side. "What's wrong?" "I don't know how to do this." you say though sobs. "It's simple, I know - but I don't know how to do this." "No worries," she says. "Let me help you. For the fruits, use what they call "the face test": Just feel the fruit and compare it to your face. If it's as hard as your forehead, it's not ripe. Just leave those. If they feel like the tip of your nose (hard, but with a little bit of give), those are ripe. If they feel soft like your cheek, those are overripe and have to be dealt with later. Here, I'll do this batch with you so you can get the hang of it." And she does. She helps you pick the ripe fruits, all the while sharing little things to look for and be aware of. When the bowl is overflowing with ripe fruits, you pick it up and the two of you walk back inside. "Thank you so much for helping me." you say. "This week has been nuts. Every day is something new and I feel like nothing I learn on one day applies to the day after. It's very frustrating to perpetually do something that you feel like a complete novice at. To continually feel like you're on the ground floor. You know what I mean?" She nods and smiles. "Let me share a secret with you," she says."We all feel like that sometimes. Everybody's gotta start somewhere. The key is to start. Start, try your best and just keep moving forward. And take comfort in the fact that you don't have to learn it all at once. Just take it a day at a time." 

 

"Here," she says as she hands you your check for the week. "I think you earned this." "Thanks so much!" you reply as you take it and start waking to the door. "Hey!" she calls out. "We have an opening available. Can you help us next week?" You smile and tuck the check into your pants pocket. "I'll see you on Monday."

 

I thought of that analogy today and I think it accurately describes how I feel about programming lately. Whatever I learn, I feel like it's not enough. And every time I have to do something that I don't know how to do (that someone says is "simple" or "foundational") I feel foolish. I get an overwhelming feeling of "I should know this by now." and "How much longer am I going to have to do this before I feel comfortable/confident doing it?" Stuff like that. I also feel like, "How much do I have to learn to start a professional career in this?" (since I'm not paid to do this yet). When will I be "good enough" to be paid to do this? What is the quantity of knowledge that you have to know to start?

 

So many people say things are simple (especially in programming) but it ignores a profound truth: Everything's simple if you know how to do it -- but learning how to do it is not simple.

 

At the end of the day, just keep pressing forward. Who knows what the future holds? (But we know who holds the future ~_^). With AI disrupting everything and global powers getting agitated, all we can do is press on and do our best.

 

Get comfortable with trying. Regardless of what happens out there, 2026 is going to be awesome for you. Now... let's make it happen.
