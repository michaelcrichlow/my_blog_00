# Hi, I'm Mike! 👋

![Profile Picture](/static/images/profile_pic.png)

I'm a software developer interested in...

### What I'm working on

- **Flask Projects**: Building custom blog engines, Dash apps, etc.
- **Python**: My first programming langauge and still my favorite.
- **Odin**: As fast as C, as ergonomic as Python (BETTER in some cases). Gotta love it.
- **Learning**: Currently diving deep into CSS Grid and UI design. Making a game with Odin and Raylib as well as a game called "Anwyl and the Cursed Tower" in GameMaker. We'll see where that goes. :)
- **Reading** - Brandon Sanderson is the MAN.
